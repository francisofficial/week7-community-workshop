# Community Workshop - Week 7 Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates **CSS transitions, keyframe animations, and JavaScript function concepts** in an interactive web page. It builds on previous weeks’ work and focuses on smooth visual effects and functional logic.

## Files
- `index.html` — The main HTML structure with multiple sections:
  - Transition example
  - Keyframe animation example
  - JavaScript function demo
- `styles.css` — Contains all styling, transitions, and animations
- `script.js` — Contains JavaScript for:
  - Animation triggers
  - Function examples with parameters and return values
  - Demonstrating variable scope

## Features
1. **CSS Transitions**
   - Hover effect on a box that changes size, color, and rotation smoothly.
2. **Keyframe Animation**
   - Button triggers a bounce animation on a box.
3. **JavaScript Functions**
   - Function with parameters and return value for calculation.
   - Demonstrates global and local variable scope.

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
2. All features run locally; no server or packages are required.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding and implementing CSS transitions and keyframe animations.
- Demonstrating JavaScript functions with parameters, return values, and scope.
- Triggering animations via event listeners.
- Clear and well-commented code for maintainability.
